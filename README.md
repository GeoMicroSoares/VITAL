# Data analysis repository for VITAL

## Summary:
 - VITAL has sequenced human genomes of patients suffering from left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) as well as a control group. This was done to infer on 
what gene alterations could be responsible for this pathology.

## Objectives:
 1. To parse data files of structural variants found for human genomes
 2. To find patterns of genetic variation across subjects.
